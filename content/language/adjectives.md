All Describing words (Adjectives and Adverbs) end in ''. For simplicity we will now call them all adjectives.

Used before a noun or verb, they help identify which noun.

	the black cat: 
	He quickly runs:  

Used after a noun it can be treated as an "is/state" verb.

	He is quick: 

Adjectives prefer to apply to following verb.

Adjectives Can also be made comparative using ''

	He is more musical than me:   

'Most' is achieved be ending in ''

	You are the busiest person in the world:   

'Least' by ending in ''

	He is the least happy person I know:     

Soo:

	Today is so hot:   

Not very:

	You are not very old:  
