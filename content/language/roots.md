Michuhu (60 Root) is built from 63 base roots, all words are a compound of these roots, and can be used to form wide set of words.

For example:

	Shop =  = Place Open Own Noun
	Boy =  = Person Small Male

The best place to start understanding the language is to understand the roots, as they each have their own sound and character and meaning.

The main shape of each letter represents the consonant sound, indicated by the left hand column. And the stroke through the vowel sound.

Phonics So the 'K - ' row on the "Roots"	 table sounds like this:
>---table class="lang_table"
*| PHONICS |  		|  		|  		|  		|  |
| Primary | Ka [Cat] | Ki [King] | Ko [Kong] | Ku [coup] | K -- ending|
| Secondary|	| kee [keep]  | Kou [Comb]| | |

Whether you use the primary or secondary sound is chosen on what sounds more comfortable at that position in a word.
