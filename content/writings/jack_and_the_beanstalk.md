Jacks mother was angry, and exclaimed: "I told you to sell it not give it away. It could have been sold for enough food to last us four months."  She sent him to bed without supper.

Without thinking Jack began to climb the beanstalk. He couldn't stop until he got to the top. He wanted to see the whole world.

But when he got to the top, he saw a very big castle on the clouds. He couldn't believe his eyes.

The castle's door was also huge and Jack could sneak under it. Once he was inside he saw a big table and on it a hen. He climbed up and watched saw the hen lay a golden egg.

He arrived before the Giant then started to climb down. When he arrived he gave the hen to his mother.

She said, "Very good, but a cow is worth much more."

So the next day, Jack climbed the beanstalk again. Once inside the castle he saw a harp that was playing itself.

The Giant stepped up to the table and jack screamed.  He grabbed the harp and ran towards the Beanstalk.  Thankfully, he arrived before the Giant and jumped down to the Beanstalk.

The Giant also began to climb down the beanstalk, so Jack climbed quickly. As he reached the bottom he shouted to his mother "Fetch the Axe".
