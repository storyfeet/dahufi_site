At first they planned to build it togeher but they quickly began arguing about what to build it with.

The first wanted to use straw becausse that would be easiest.

The second wanted to use sticks because they would be easy enough, but also stronger than a house made of straw.

In the end they decided each pig should build their own house.

The first two pigs quickly built their houses. In no time at all they were finished, then they began laughing at the third pig because he was so slow.

One day later, a wolf arrived. He really wanted to eat the pigs.  He knocked on the first's door and said. "Little Pig, Little Pig. Let me come in".
